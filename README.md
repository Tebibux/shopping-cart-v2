# Shopping Cart Project

Welcome to the Shopping Cart project! This project is designed to help you practice building a shopping cart feature in a web application. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, features, getting started instructions, project structure, and additional notes.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create a simple shopping cart web application. The goal is to allow users to browse a list of products, add them to their cart, adjust quantities, and view the total cost of their selections. While this is a simplified version of a real e-commerce platform, it covers the core concepts of building a shopping cart functionality.

## Features

- Display a list of products with details (e.g., name, price, description, image).
- Allow users to add products to their shopping cart.
- Enable users to adjust the quantity of items in their cart.
- Calculate and display the total cost of items in the cart.
- Provide a checkout option (Note: In this project, you can simulate the checkout process; no actual payment processing is required).
